# Audio Streaming System

This project showcases a distributed **Audio Streaming System** developed in Java, focused on applying modern approaches to service-oriented architecture and inter-process communication. By implementing RESTful APIs with **JAX-RS**, asynchronous messaging with **JMS**, and data persistence using **MySQL**, I gained hands-on experience with some of the most popular and widely-adopted technologies for building scalable backend systems. The project covers the complete flow of REST API communication, backend message routing, modular service design, and relational database integration.

The client application itself is designed much like a specialized **API client tool** — similar in spirit to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) — providing a graphical interface for constructing, sending, and analyzing HTTP requests and responses throughout the distributed system.

> The primary motivation behind this project was to learn **RESTful API communication** using **JAX-RS**, as well as asynchronous messaging with **JMS** in Java. Through implementing a multi-tier, service-based system, I deepened my understanding of distributed architectures, modern Java frameworks, and real-world API design patterns.
